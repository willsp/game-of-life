# Game of Life

A simple iteration over generations where cells
live and die based on a few simple rules.

* A live cell with fewer than 2 living neighbors
dies.
* A live cell with more than 3 living neighbors
dies.
* A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors
comes to life.

## Setup

1. Configure how big (width, height) you want your
game board to be.
2. Check the boxes to indicate which cells should
start the game living.
3. Click _Next Generation_ to find out who lives
and dies.
